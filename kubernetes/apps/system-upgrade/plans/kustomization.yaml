  # Upgrade Plans will be automatically included when generated by GitHub Actions
  # Pattern: 01-talos-workers-upgrade.yaml, 02-talos-controlplane-upgrade.yaml
  #
  # Both Plans are automatically applied by Flux after PR merge.
  # Control plane Plan uses 'after:' field to wait for workers to complete.
  #
  # Note: This directory will be empty until a PR is created when
  # Renovate updates talconfig.yaml. The generate-upgrade-plans
  # GitHub Action will create Plans and commit them to the PR.
