  # Worker upgrade Plans will be automatically included when generated by GitHub Actions
  # Pattern: 01-talos-workers-upgrade.yaml
  #
  # Control plane upgrade Plans are NOT automatically applied by Flux
  # They must be manually applied after workers complete:
  #   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/apps/system-upgrade/plans/02-talos-controlplane-upgrade.yaml
  #
  # Note: This directory will be empty until a PR is created by the
  # talos-version-check GitHub Action. When new Talos versions are
  # detected, the workflow will create Plans and commit them here.
