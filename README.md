# ‚õµ K8s Homelab Cluster

Welcome to my opinionated Kubernetes cluster.

## ‚ú® Features

The features included will depend on the type of configuration you want to use. There are currently **2 different types** of **configurations** available with this template.

1. **"Flux cluster"** - a Kubernetes cluster deployed on-top of [Talos Linux](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos) with an opinionated implementation of [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) using [GitHub](https://github.com/) as the Git provider and [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) to manage secrets.

    - **Required:** Some knowledge of [Containers](https://opencontainers.org/), [YAML](https://yaml.org/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
    - **Components:** [flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium), [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager), [spegel](https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel), [reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader), and [openebs](https://github.com/openebs/openebs).

2. **"Flux cluster with Cloudflare"** - An addition to "**Flux cluster**" that provides DNS and SSL with [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/) is also included to provide external access to certain applications deployed in your cluster.

    - **Required:** A Cloudflare account with a domain managed in your Cloudflare account.
    - **Components:** [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/), [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) and [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared).

**Other features include:**

- A [Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate)-ready repository with pull request diffs provided by [flux-local](https://github.com/allenporter/flux-local)
- Integrated [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with helpful workflows.

## üöÄ Getting Started

#### Devcontainer method

1. Start Docker and open your repository in VSCode. There will be a pop-up asking you to use the `devcontainer`, click the button to start using it.

2. Continue on to üîß [**Stage 3**](#-stage-3-bootstrap-configuration)

### üîß Stage 3: Bootstrap configuration

> [!NOTE]
> The [config.sample.yaml](./config.sample.yaml) file contains config that is **vital** to the bootstrap process.

1. Generate the `config.yaml` from the [config.sample.yaml](./config.sample.yaml) configuration file.

    ```sh
    task init
    ```

2. Fill out the `config.yaml` configuration file using the comments in that file as a guide.

3. Run the following command which will generate all the files needed to continue.

    ```sh
    task configure
    ```

4. Push you changes to git

   üìç _**Verify** all the `./kubernetes/**/*.sops.*` files are **encrypted** with SOPS_

    ```sh
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Initial commit :rocket:"
    git push
    ```

### ‚õµ Stage 4: Install Kubernetes

1. Deploy your cluster and bootstrap it. This generates secrets, generates the config files for your nodes and applies them. It bootstraps the cluster afterwards, fetches the kubeconfig file and installs Cilium and kubelet-csr-approver. It finishes with some health checks.

    ```sh
    task bootstrap:talos
    ```

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è It might take a while for the cluster to be setup (10+ minutes is normal), during which time you will see a variety of error messages like: "couldn't get current server API group list," "error: no matching resources found", etc. This is a normal. If this step gets interrupted, e.g. by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, you likely will need to [nuke the cluster](#-Nuke) before trying again.

#### Cluster validation

1. The `kubeconfig` for interacting with your cluster should have been created in the root of your repository.

2. Verify the nodes are online

    üìç _If this command **fails** you likely haven't configured `direnv` as [mentioned previously](#non-devcontainer-method) in the guide._

    ```sh
    kubectl get nodes -o wide
    # NAME           STATUS   ROLES                       AGE     VERSION
    # k8s-0          Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   1h      v1.30.1
    # k8s-1          Ready    worker                      1h      v1.30.1
    ```

3. Continue on to üîπ [**Stage 6**](#-stage-6-install-flux-in-your-cluster)

### üîπ Stage 6: Install Flux in your cluster

1. Verify Flux can be installed

    ```sh
    flux check --pre
    # ‚ñ∫ checking prerequisites
    # ‚úî kubectl 1.30.1 >=1.18.0-0
    # ‚úî Kubernetes 1.30.1 >=1.16.0-0
    # ‚úî prerequisites checks passed
    ```

2. Install Flux and sync the cluster to the Git repository

    ```sh
    task bootstrap:flux
    # namespace/flux-system configured
    # customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/alerts.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io created
    # ...
    ```

3. Verify Flux components are running in the cluster

    ```sh
    kubectl -n flux-system get pods -o wide
    # NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    # helm-controller-5bbd94c75-89sb4            1/1     Running   0          1h
    # kustomize-controller-7b67b6b77d-nqc67      1/1     Running   0          1h
    # notification-controller-7c46575844-k4bvr   1/1     Running   0          1h
    # source-controller-7d6875bcb4-zqw9f         1/1     Running   0          1h
    ```

## üí• Reset

There might be a situation where you want to destroy your Kubernetes cluster. The following command will reset your nodes back to maintenance mode, append `--force` to completely format your the Talos installation. Either way the nodes should reboot after the command has run.

```sh
task talos:reset # --force
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Talos and Kubernetes Maintenance

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Updating Talos node configuration

üìç _Ensure you have updated `talconfig.yaml` and any patches with your updated configuration._

```sh
# (Re)generate the Talos config
task talos:generate-config
# Apply the config to the node
task talos:apply-node HOSTNAME=? MODE=?
# e.g. task talos:apply-config HOSTNAME=k8s-0 MODE=auto
```

#### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Updating Talos and Kubernetes versions

üìç _Ensure the `talosVersion` and `kubernetesVersion` in `talhelper.yaml` are up-to-date with the version you wish to upgrade to._

```sh
# Upgrade node to a newer Talos version
task talos:upgrade-node HOSTNAME=?
# e.g. task talos:upgrade HOSTNAME=k8s-0
```

```sh
# Upgrade cluster to a newer Kubernetes version
task talos:upgrade-k8s
# e.g. task talos:upgrade-k8s
```

## üêõ Debugging

Below is a general guide on trying to debug an issue with an resource or application. For example, if a workload/resource is not showing up or a pod has started but in a `CrashLoopBackOff` or `Pending` state.

1. Start by checking all Flux Kustomizations & Git Repository & OCI Repository and verify they are healthy.

    ```sh
    flux get sources oci -A
    flux get sources git -A
    flux get ks -A
    ```

2. Then check all the Flux Helm Releases and verify they are healthy.

    ```sh
    flux get hr -A
    ```

3. Then check the if the pod is present.

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> get pods -o wide
    ```

4. Then check the logs of the pod if its there.

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> logs <pod-name> -f
    # or
    stern -n <namespace> <fuzzy-name>
    ```

5. If a resource exists try to describe it to see what problems it might have.

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> describe <resource> <name>
    ```

6. Check the namespace events

    ```sh
    kubectl -n <namespace> get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
    ```

Resolving problems that you have could take some tweaking of your YAML manifests in order to get things working, other times it could be a external factor like permissions on NFS. If you are unable to figure out your problem see the help section below.

## ‚ùî What's next

### DNS

Instead of using [k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) to provide DNS for your applications you might want to check out [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns), it has wide support for many different providers such as [Pi-hole](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/pihole.md), [UniFi](https://github.com/kashalls/external-dns-unifi-webhook), [Adguard Home](https://github.com/muhlba91/external-dns-provider-adguard), [Bind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/rfc2136.md) and more.
